## Next Steps

### Short Term (Next 1-2 weeks)
1. âœ… **Dependency Installation**: Install Node.js dependencies and verify build system - COMPLETED
2. **SSH Key Handling**: Implement SSH key file reading and parsing functionality
3. **Cryptographic Operations**: Add Web Crypto API integration for challenge decryption
4. **Network Interception**: Complete network request interception for auth challenges
5. **Secure Storage**: Implement secure key storage and retrieval mechanisms
6. **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### Medium Term (Next 1-2 months)
1. **Authentication Testing**: Test complete challenge-response cycles with real SSH keys
2. **UI Enhancement**: Improve popup interface with better status indicators
3. **Security Audit**: Conduct security review of cryptographic implementation
4. **Performance Testing**: Benchmark authentication response times
5. **Browser Testing**: Verify functionality across different Chromium browsers

### Long Term (3+ months)
1. **Multi-Browser Support**: Extend compatibility beyond Chromium (Firefox, Safari)
2. **Advanced Key Support**: Support for multiple SSH key formats and key pairs
3. **Enterprise Features**: Integration with enterprise authentication systems
4. **Performance Optimization**: Minimize extension impact on browsing performance
5. **User Experience Refinement**: Polish UI/UX based on user feedback and testing

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Component Isolation**: Strict separation between background service (key access) and content scripts (page interaction)
- **Security First**: Private keys never exposed to content script context
- **Event-Driven Design**: Authentication triggered by network events rather than polling

### Technical Choices
- **Manifest V3**: Required for modern browser compatibility
- **TypeScript**: Chosen for type safety and maintainability
- **Webpack**: Selected for flexible build system supporting extension requirements

### Security Considerations
- **Key Containment**: Background service only context with key access
- **Minimal Permissions**: Request only necessary browser permissions
- **No External APIs**: Self-contained cryptography to avoid third-party risks

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- **Feature-Based Structure**: Organize code by functionality (background/, content/, popup/)
- **Shared Utilities**: Common functions in shared/ directory
- **Type Definitions**: Centralized TypeScript interfaces and types

### Development Practices
- **Strict TypeScript**: Enable strict mode for maximum type safety
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests for all components
- **Security Reviews**: Regular security audits of cryptographic operations

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Extension continues functioning if individual features fail
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and status indicators
- **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging and monitoring

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights
- **Browser Extension Constraints**: Understanding limitations of WebExtensions API
- **Cryptography in Browsers**: Web Crypto API capabilities and limitations
- **Security Boundaries**: Importance of proper context isolation

### Project Management
- **Documentation Importance**: Memory Bank approach ensures continuity
- **Incremental Development**: Building core functionality before advanced features
- **Security Mindset**: Every decision evaluated through security lens

### User Experience
- **Transparency**: Users need visibility into authentication processes
- **Simplicity**: Complex cryptography should be invisible to end users
- **Reliability**: Authentication failures should not break user workflows

## Current State Assessment

### What's Working
- âœ… Project scope and requirements clearly defined
- âœ… Architecture patterns established and implemented
- âœ… Technical foundation documented and configured
- âœ… Development roadmap planned and Phase 1 completed
- âœ… Complete extension skeleton with all components
- âœ… Build system and development environment ready
- âœ… Component communication framework established
- âœ… Security-first architecture with proper isolation

### What's Pending
