# SSH Authentication Extension - Project Brief

## Overview
This project develops a Chromium browser extension that simplifies authentication for remote Web sites using a SSH key.

## Core Requirements
- **SSH Key Management**: Provide interface for configuring a pre-created SSH key
- **Authentication Integration**: Seamlessly integrate SSH authentication with a remote Web site
- **Security**: Implement secure key storage and authentication practices
- **User Experience**: Intuitive UI for managing SSH connections and authentication

## Success Criteria
- Extension deployable in a Chromium browser
- Supports key-based SSH authentication methods
- Provides clear feedback and error handling for authentication issues

## Scope
- Focus on inputing the file path to a SSH key pair, recognizing when a Web site issues a challenge, and responding by decrypting the challenge using the SSH secret key
- Target Chromium browser platforms, including Chrome and Brave

## Constraints
- Must follow Chromium browser extension development best practices
- Cannot store sensitive data insecurely
- Must handle authentication securely without exposing credentials
- Must securely self-custody the SSH private key, keep it secret, and never expose it
