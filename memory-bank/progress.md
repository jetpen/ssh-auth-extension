## Known Issues

### Current Issues
- **None identified** - Project in early planning phase

### Anticipated Challenges
- **Cryptographic Implementation**: Complex SSH key operations in browser constraints
- **Security Boundaries**: Ensuring private keys never leave secure context
- **Browser Compatibility**: Handling differences between Chromium browsers
- **Performance Impact**: Minimizing extension overhead on web browsing

### Technical Debt
- **None yet** - Clean slate project

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Scope Refinement
- **Initial Concept**: Started as VSCode extension concept
- **Current Reality**: Corrected to Chromium browser extension for web SSH auth
- **Rationale**: Aligns with actual requirements and browser extension capabilities

### Architecture Decisions
- **Security-First Approach**: Prioritized component isolation and key containment
- **Event-Driven Design**: Chose reactive model over polling for better performance
- **Manifest V3**: Required for modern browser support and security

### Technology Choices
- **TypeScript**: Selected for type safety in complex cryptographic operations
- **Webpack**: Chosen for flexible extension bundling requirements
- **Jest + Puppeteer**: Testing stack for both unit and integration coverage

## Metrics and KPIs

### Development Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: Target 80%+ coverage
- **Build Time**: Target <30 seconds for development builds
- **Bundle Size**: Target <2MB compressed extension bundle
- **Performance**: <100ms authentication response time

### Quality Metrics
- **Zero Security Vulnerabilities**: Cryptographic implementation must pass security review
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Must work on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Error Rate**: <1% authentication failure rate in normal operation

### User Experience Metrics
- **Setup Time**: <5 minutes for initial configuration
- **Success Rate**: >95% successful authentications when properly configured
- **User Satisfaction**: Target 4.5+ star rating on extension stores

## Blockers and Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **Browser APIs**: Dependent on WebExtensions API stability
- **Cryptography Standards**: Relies on SSH protocol specifications
- **Web Standards**: Dependent on evolving web platform capabilities

### Internal Dependencies
- **Security Review**: All cryptographic code requires security audit
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing setup needed before feature development
- **Documentation**: Memory Bank must be maintained as project evolves

## Next Critical Path

### Immediate Next Steps (Next 1-2 weeks)
1. âœ… Install Node.js dependencies and verify build system - COMPLETED
2. Implement SSH key file reading and parsing functionality
3. Add cryptographic challenge decryption using Web Crypto API
4. Complete network request interception for auth challenges
5. Implement secure key storage and retrieval
6. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### Success Criteria for Next Phase
