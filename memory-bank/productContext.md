# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

Modern web applications increasingly require secure authentication mechanisms beyond traditional passwords. SSH key-based authentication provides strong security through asymmetric cryptography, but integrating SSH keys with web-based authentication flows remains challenging for users.

This extension bridges the gap between SSH key infrastructure and web authentication, enabling users to leverage their existing SSH keys for secure web login without additional credential management.

## Problems Solved

### Current Pain Points
- **Credential Proliferation**: Users must manage separate credentials for SSH access and web authentication
- **Security Complexity**: Web applications struggle to implement robust SSH-based authentication
- **User Experience Gap**: No seamless way to use SSH keys for web login in browsers
- **Key Management Overhead**: Users need to manually handle SSH key operations for web auth

### Target User Problems
- Difficulty integrating SSH keys with web-based authentication systems
- Security risks from password reuse across multiple systems
- Complexity of implementing SSH challenge-response in web contexts
- Lack of browser-native SSH key authentication support

## How It Should Work

### Core User Flow
1. **Setup**: User configures path to existing SSH key pair in extension settings
2. **Detection**: Extension monitors web requests for SSH authentication challenges
3. **Authentication**: Automatically responds to challenges using configured SSH private key
4. **Seamless Experience**: User experiences transparent authentication without manual intervention

### Key Interactions
- **Configuration Interface**: Simple UI for SSH key path and optional passphrase
- **Challenge Detection**: Passive monitoring of HTTP requests/responses for auth challenges
- **Key Decryption**: Secure in-browser decryption of SSH challenges using private key
- **Status Feedback**: Clear indicators of authentication success/failure

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Goals
- **Zero-Configuration Authentication**: Once set up, authentication happens automatically
- **Security Transparency**: Users understand when and how SSH keys are being used
- **Error Clarity**: Clear feedback when authentication fails or keys are misconfigured
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on browsing performance

### Secondary Goals
- **Accessibility**: Works across different Chromium browsers (Chrome, Brave, Edge)
- **Privacy**: No external data transmission of sensitive key material
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
